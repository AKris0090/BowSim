# BowSim

#### This project was the result of a week-long summer course at Digipen Institute of Technology. The game is a bow and arrow simulation, and has a mini-game on one side and a separate target range on the opposite side. I have implemented an interact button, and it can be activated by pressing a key when close to the buttons. Interacting with the yellow floating arrows reload the total number of arrows back to 25. Arrows stick into targets, and shooting the board in the corner of the room shows how they go through the objects they hit.

#### I spent a long while working on a 3D model of a compound bow, which is the main weapon I included. It was very challenging to get the bowstring working as I wanted, and only found a working solution after a couple of days. I made all of the animations, including the walking, running, drawing the bowstring back, aiming down sights, and reloading in Blender. From there, I imported everything into Unreal Engine and coded all of the logic using Unreal Engineâ€™s blueprint system. Lastly, I added a tracer to the arrows using a Niagara Particle Emitter System, which I had to research and learn how exactly to use.
